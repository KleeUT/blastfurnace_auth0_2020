This will ask the student to:

- add a private route,
- Install JWT and JWKS libraries
- Add middleware to check the header using Auth0 libraries.
- Validate the audience
- Return a value when the header is present .
- Return a 403 if the header is wrong or not present.
- Try a token from a friends api to see that the token is important.
