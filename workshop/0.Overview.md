# Pre-requisites

To run the code in this sample you will need to have NodeJS installed at 12 or above.

This workshop is broken into 4 parts and the intention is you can move at your own pace.

## [1. Getting The User's Identity](1.GettingTheUsersIdentity.md)

[Start here](1.GettingTheUsersIdentity) to set up the web client and an Auth0 tenant to enable a user to sign up and log into your application.

## [2. Getting An Access Token](2.GettingAnAccessToken.md)

[Continue here](2.GettingAnAccessToken.md) to build on what was done in part one and get an access token that can be used to access secure APIs.

## [3. Secure an API](3.SecureAnAPI.md)

[Continue here](3.SecureAnAPI.md) to build an API that can be restricted so that it can only be accessed by a client that has an access token. This builds on the Auth0 tenant that was created in the first step.

## [4. Use The Access Token](4.UseTheAccessToken.md)

[This final section](4.UseTheAccessToken.md) wires the client that was set up in part 1 and 2 into the API that we set up in part 3.

> If you want to just skip to the end you can clone the `final-state` branch and you'll be able to start the Web app and the API to see how it all fits together
