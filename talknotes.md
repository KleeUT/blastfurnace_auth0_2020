# Problem Statement

Authentication is one of those things. On the outside it's pretty simple. Everyone has used it before. Everyone has an opinion about how it should be done. Because it is so ubiquitous it seems like it should be easy. It's also so ubiquitous that it adds pretty much no value to your application. I cant think of a single time that I went back to a website because they had such a great authentication experience.

Add on top of this that it is so easy to get wrong. Now you're asking what do you mean it's easy to get wrong. You just said that it's every where. Everyone knows how to log in. What I mean when I say that it's easy to get wrong is that there are technical decisions that need to be made that really you dont want to be thinking about because you want to be getting your users into your application and using it.

Things like:

How do you store passwords

1. BCrypt
2. MD5
3. SHA256
4. RS232

Some other stuff that sounds complex
